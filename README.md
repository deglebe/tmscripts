# tmscripts
a collection of various tampermonkey scripts i have written to improve my
experience using the web

i'm in the process of cleaning up/aggregating a lot of these, and as such, they
may not include localisations/features/completeness that makes them work
as intended for everyone. i usually update them to function on sites which i
frequent, but i'm always happy to accept patches or ammend issues which are
reported.

### hide youtube shorts
hides the youtube short shelves on the homepage/channel page with css, with
a fallback for any future changes

### kill google one-tap
removes and keeps removing the google one-tap popup globally

### cookie autoreject
automatically clicks reject cookies on gdpr-compliant cmp cookie banners

*help wanted: further localisations for international websites*
